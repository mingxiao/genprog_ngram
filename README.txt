This is an experiment to see if genprog can be used on a student program.

The program I will be testing is:
/Users/mingxiao10016/Downloads/user/skinamdar/2/9/selsortfinished.c

Test cases and expected output are in: 
/Users/mingxiao10016/Desktop/my-genprog-test/tests/hw9/selsortcomplex.test

Now to setup test.sh

We have positive test cases, but now we need NEGATIVE test cases. What is a negative test case for a sorting function?
